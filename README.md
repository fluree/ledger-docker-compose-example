# fluree-docker-example

This project provides an example of how to serve Fluree instances in Docker containers.

## Get Started

1. Clone or download this repository onto your machine.

```
git clone https://github.com/fluree/fluree-docker-example.git

cd fluree-docker-example
```

#### Single-Node Fluree

If you want to run Fluree as a single, centralized server, you can do so by going to `docker-compose.cluster.yml` and commenting out everything below the line that says `# comment out the below services to run a single-node Fluree network`.

You can then start Fluree by issuing `docker-compose up` in your terminal.

Navigate to `http://localhost:8090/` to see the administrative user interface. 

#### Multi-Node Fluree

To run a Fluree network with three servers, simply issue: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.cluster.yml up`. 

If you want to run a network with a different number of servers, you can edit the `docker-compose.cluster.yml` file to include more servers. 


#### Customizing Fluree 
Both the single-node and multi-node configurations of Fluree will work without changing any of the configurations. However, if you want change any of the node's configurations, you can do so by passing in environment variables. 

Information regarding configurable Fluree settings is available online. The `Getting Started -> Installation` section provides insight on installing and customizing Fluree (https://docs.flur.ee/docs/getting-started/installation).


## Verify container
The Docker Dashboard is useful to verify/access the container and fluree service.  Via the dashboard, you can inspect environment settings, review logs, open a CLI terminal session and even browse to the Fluree Admin UI site.

If you are a command-line aficionado, the following commands are useful to verify that your Fluree service is up and running:

---
**command**: `docker container ls`

| CONTAINER ID | IMAGE | COMMAND | CREATED | STATUS | PORTS | NAMES |
