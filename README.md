# Fluree ledger docker-compose example

This project provides an example of how to serve Fluree instances in Docker 
containers using docker-compose.

## Get Started
Clone or download this repository onto your machine.

```
git clone https://github.com/fluree/ledger-docker-compose-example.git

cd ledger-docker-compose-example
```

#### Single-Node Fluree

If you want to run Fluree as a single, centralized server, you can do so by 
just running `docker-compose up` in the directory where you cloned this 
repo.

Navigate to `http://localhost:8090/` to see the administrative user interface. 

#### Multi-Node Fluree

To run a Fluree network with three servers, simply issue: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.cluster.yml up`. 

If you want to run a network with a different number of servers, you can edit the `docker-compose.cluster.yml` file to include more servers.

Note that it is recommended to only run 3 or 5 node clusters. Due to the
way the raft consensus protocol works running 2, 4, or 6-node (or larger) 
clusters either adds no additional redundancy or introduces more overhead 
than it is worth.

#### Customizing Fluree
Both the single-node and multi-node configurations of Fluree will work 
without changing any of the configurations. However, if you want to change 
any of the node's configurations, you can do so by passing in environment 
variables. 

Information regarding configurable Fluree settings is available online. The 
`Getting Started -> Installation` section provides insight on installing 
and customizing Fluree (https://docs.flur.ee/docs/getting-started/
installation).

## Verify container
The Docker Dashboard is useful to verify/access the container and fluree 
service.  Via the dashboard, you can inspect environment settings, review 
logs, open a CLI terminal session and even browse to the Fluree Admin UI 
site.

If you are a command-line aficionado, the following commands are useful to verify that your Fluree service is up and running:
